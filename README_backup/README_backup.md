An extensive Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) benchmark. Our goal is to provide a unified framework for RL-based CO algorithms, and to facilitate reproducible research in this field, decoupling the science from the engineering.


RL4CO is built upon:
- [TorchRL](https://github.com/pytorch/rl): official PyTorch framework for RL algorithms and vectorized environments on GPUs
- [TensorDict](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/tensordict): a library to easily handle heterogeneous data such as states, actions and rewards
- [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning): a lightweight PyTorch wrapper for high-performance AI research
- [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra): a framework for elegantly configuring complex applications

</div>

We offer flexible and efficient implementations of the following policies:
- **Constructive**: learn to construct a solution from scratch
  - _Autoregressive (AR)_: construct solutions one step at a time via a decoder
  - _NonAutoregressive (NAR)_: learn to predict a heuristic, such as a heatmap, to then construct a solution
- **Improvement**: learn to improve a pre-existing solution

</div>

We provide several utilities and modularization. For example, we modularize reusable components such as _environment embeddings_ that can easily be swapped to [solve new problems](https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co/blob/main/examples/3-creating-new-env-model.ipynb).

## Getting started
<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ai4co/rl4co/blob/main/examples/1-quickstart.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"></a>

RL4CO is now available for installation on `pip`!
```bash
pip install rl4co
```

To get started, we recommend checking out our [quickstart notebook](examples/1-quickstart.ipynb) or the [minimalistic example](#minimalistic-example) below.

### Install from source
This command installs the bleeding edge `main` version, useful for staying up-to-date with the latest developments - for instance, if a bug has been fixed since the last official release but a new release hasn’t been rolled out yet:

```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co.git
```

### Local install and development
If you want to develop RL4CO we recommend you to install it locally with `pip` in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co && cd rl4co
pip install -e .
```

We recommend using a virtual environment such as `conda` to install `rl4co` locally.



## Usage


Train model with default configuration (AM on TSP environment):
```bash
python run.py
```

> [!TIP]
> You may check out [this notebook](examples/advanced/1-hydra-config.ipynb) to get started with Hydra!

<details>
    <summary>Change experiment settings</summary>

Train model with chosen experiment configuration from [configs/experiment/](configs/experiment/)
```bash
python run.py experiment=routing/am env=tsp env.num_loc=50 model.optimizer_kwargs.lr=2e-4
```
Here you may change the environment, e.g. with `env=cvrp` by command line or by modifying the corresponding experiment e.g. [configs/experiment/routing/am.yaml](configs/experiment/routing/am.yaml).

</details>




<details>
    <summary>Disable logging</summary>

```bash
python run.py experiment=routing/am logger=none '~callbacks.learning_rate_monitor'
```
Note that `~` is used to disable a callback that would need a logger.

</details>


<details>
    <summary>Create a sweep over hyperparameters (-m for multirun)</summary>

```bash
python run.py -m experiment=routing/am  model.optimizer.lr=1e-3,1e-4,1e-5
```
</details>



### Minimalistic Example

Here is a minimalistic example training the Attention Model with greedy rollout baseline on TSP in less than 30 lines of code:

```python
from rl4co.envs.routing import TSPEnv, TSPGenerator
from rl4co.models import AttentionModelPolicy, POMO
from rl4co.utils import RL4COTrainer

# Instantiate generator and environment
generator = TSPGenerator(num_loc=50, loc_distribution="uniform")
env = TSPEnv(generator)

# Create policy and RL model
policy = AttentionModelPolicy(env_name=env.name, num_encoder_layers=6)
model = POMO(env, policy, batch_size=64, optimizer_kwargs={"lr": 1e-4})

# Instantiate Trainer and fit
trainer = RL4COTrainer(max_epochs=10, accelerator="gpu", precision="16-mixed")
trainer.fit(model)
```

Other examples can be found on our [documentation](https://rl4.co/examples/1-quickstart/)!


### Testing

Run tests with `pytest` from the root directory:

```bash
pytest tests
```

### Known Bugs


#### Bugs installing PyTorch Geometric (PyG)

Installing `PyG` via `Conda` seems to update Torch itself. We have found that this update introduces some bugs with `torchrl`. At this moment, we recommend installing `PyG` with `Pip`:
```bash
pip install torch_geometric
```
