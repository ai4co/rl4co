    Download an object from S3 with a progress bar.


    Now actually download the object, with a progress bar to match.
    How this works:

    -   We take manual control of tqdm() using a ``with`` statement,
        see https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/#manual

    -   We set ``unit_scale=True`` so tqdm uses SI unit prefixes, and
       ``unit="B"`` means it adds a "B" as a suffix.  This means we get
        progress info like "14.5kB/s".

        (Note: the "B" is just a string; tqdm doesn't know these are
        bytes and doesn't care.)

    -   The Callback method on a boto3 S3 function is called
        periodically during the download with the number of bytes
        transferred.  We can use it to update the progress bar.
