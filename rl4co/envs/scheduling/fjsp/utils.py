    1.) Operations may only start once their direct predecessor is finished. We calculate its lower bound by
    adding the minimum possible operation time to this detected start time. However, we cannot use the proc_times
    directly, but need to account for the fact, that machines might still be busy, once an operation can be processed.
    We detect this offset by detecting ops-machine pairs, where the first possible start point of the operation is before
    the machine becomes idle again - Therefore, we add this discrepancy to the proc_time of the respective ops-ma combination

    2.) If an operation has been scheduled, we use its actual finishing time as lower bound. In this case, using the cumulative sum
    of all peedecessors of a job does not make sense, since it is likely to differ from the real finishing time of its direct
    predecessor (its only a lower bound). Therefore, we add the finish time to the cumulative sum of processing time of all
    UNSCHEDULED operations, to obtain the lower bound.
    Making this work is a bit hacky: We compute the first differences of finishing times of those operations scheduled and
    add them to the matrix of processing times, where already processed operations are masked (with zero)
