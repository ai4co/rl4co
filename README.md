RL4CO has been accepted as an oral presentation at the [NeurIPS 2023 GLFrontiers Workshop](https://glfrontiers.github.io/)! ðŸŽ‰

---


An extensive Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) benchmark. Our goal is to provide a unified framework for RL-based CO algorithms, and to facilitate reproducible research in this field, decoupling the science from the engineering.


RL4CO is built upon:
- [TorchRL](https://github.com/pytorch/rl): official PyTorch framework for RL algorithms and vectorized environments on GPUs
- [TensorDict](https://github.com/pytorch-labs/tensordict): a library to easily handle heterogeneous data such as states, actions and rewards
- [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning): a lightweight PyTorch wrapper for high-performance AI research
- [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra): a framework for elegantly configuring complex applications

![RL4CO Overview](https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co/assets/34462374/4d9a670f-ab7c-4fc8-9135-82d17cb6d0ee)


We provide several utilities and modularization. For autoregressive policies, we modularize reusable components such as _environment embeddings_ that can easily be swapped to [solve new problems](https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co/blob/main/notebooks/tutorials/2-creating-new-env-model.ipynb)
![RL4CO Policy](https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co/assets/48984123/ca88f159-d0b3-459e-8fd9-89799be9d1b0)

## Getting started
<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ai4co/rl4co/blob/main/notebooks/1-quickstart.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"></a>

RL4CO is now available for installation on `pip`!
```bash
pip install rl4co
```

To get started, we recommend checking out our [quickstart notebook](notebooks/1-quickstart.ipynb) or the [minimalistic example](#minimalistic-example) below.

### Install from source
This command installs the bleeding edge `main` version, useful for staying up-to-date with the latest developments - for instance, if a bug has been fixed since the last official release but a new release hasnâ€™t been rolled out yet:

```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co.git
```

### Local install and development
If you want to develop RL4CO we recommend you to install it locally with `pip` in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai4co/rl4co && cd rl4co
pip install -e .
```

We recommend using a virtual environment such as `conda` to install `rl4co` locally.



## Usage


Train model with default configuration (AM on TSP environment):
```bash
python run.py
```


<details>
    <summary>Change experiment</summary>

Train model with chosen experiment configuration from [configs/experiment/](configs/experiment/) (e.g. tsp/am, and environment with 42 cities)
```bash
python run.py experiment=routing/am env.num_loc=42
```
</details>


<details>
    <summary>Disable logging</summary>

```bash
python run.py experiment=routing/am logger=none '~callbacks.learning_rate_monitor'
```
Note that `~` is used to disable a callback that would need a logger.

</details>


<details>
    <summary>Create a sweep over hyperparameters (-m for multirun)</summary>

```bash
python run.py -m experiment=routing/am  train.optimizer.lr=1e-3,1e-4,1e-5
```
</details>



### Minimalistic Example

Here is a minimalistic example training the Attention Model with greedy rollout baseline on TSP in less than 30 lines of code:

```python
from rl4co.envs import TSPEnv
from rl4co.models import AttentionModel
from rl4co.utils import RL4COTrainer

# Environment, Model, and Lightning Module
env = TSPEnv(num_loc=20)
model = AttentionModel(env,
                       baseline="rollout",
                       train_data_size=100_000,
                       test_data_size=10_000,
                       optimizer_kwargs={'lr': 1e-4}
                       )

# Trainer
trainer = RL4COTrainer(max_epochs=3)

# Fit the model
trainer.fit(model)

# Test the model
trainer.test(model)
```

Other examples can be found on the [documentation](https://rl4co.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)!


### Testing

Run tests with `pytest` from the root directory:

```bash
pytest tests
```

### Known Bugs


#### Bugs installing PyTorch Geometric (PyG)

Installing `PyG` via `Conda` seems to update Torch itself. We have found that this update introduces some bugs with `torchrl`. At this moment, we recommend installing `PyG` with `Pip`:
```bash
pip install torch_geometric
```
